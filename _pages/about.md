With a background in engineering and art studies, I joined a digital humanities lab, where I now work at the intersection of arts and technology. In my spare time — which is disappearing at an unprecedented rate — I work as a film critic. I enjoy writing about films, theater performances, and festival institutions and I have done so both in the academic field and the cultural industry. Currently, I am PhD candidate in Performing Arts and Digital Humanities at Rennes 2 University under joint supervision with the University of Montréal, working on the ERC-funded project STAGE. My research focuses on the digital archives of the festival Off Avignon.

 You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
